## This Repository provides the jupyter-notebook submitted for the seminar "Selected Topics in Data-Science" at the bergische Universit√§t Wuppertal.

## Goal of this seminar is not to actually write a paper, but to ensure that the students can write scientifically for their upcoming Bachelors or Masters-Thesis.

### At the start of the seminar participants have to choose a topic they want to cover. The topics can include e-commerce, 3D-Rendering, Adversarial Attacks etc.
### I chose the topic explainability (XAI) and am glad that I did ,because it not only did i learn the basics of XAI, but it showed me how important XAI is and how important its role will be in the future.

### Feel free to check out my submission.
